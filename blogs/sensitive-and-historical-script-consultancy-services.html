Our formal approach ensures that all feedback is delivered in a professional and constructive manner designed to help our clients improve their scripts.

Our goal is to empower creators and provide them with the information they need to create compelling works that accurately and respectfully capture historical events or cultural contexts. <br><br>As a consultancy service, we encourage an open exchange of ideas and welcome feedback from our clients. Our team is prepared to work closely with writers, directors, and producers to ensure that their creative vision is realised in a culturally and historically sensitive manner. <br><br>These days more than ever, it is crucial to take cultural sensitivity and historical accuracy seriously in the media we produce. As such, our consultancy service is committed to helping creators create content that is both powerful and culturally accurate. We believe that by understanding the complexities of different cultures and historical events, we can create better media that reflects the diversity of our world. <br><br>In conclusion, if you are working on a project that requires expert script analysis and consultation, our sensitive and historical script consultants are ready to advise you. We offer a comprehensive range of services to meet your needs, from consultancy and script analysis to cultural context and historical sensitivity. Our team of experts is dedicated to helping you create compelling, culturally sensitive, and historically accurate media and ready to help you navigate the MENAT region's complex historical, cultural, political and religious landscapes.<br></p>
